Scenario: Update a user using PUT
    Given the base URI is "https://reqres.in"
    When I send a PUT request to "/api/users/2" with body:
      """
      {
        "name": "CCCCC",
        "job": "DDDDD"
      }
      """
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain "job" as "CCCCC"
